What is docker?

Docker is a container engine

It performs 3 main functions
a) It packages application
b) It includes everything necessary for functioning
c) Compatible with other operating systems

To better understand docker, first we need to understand what monolithic architecture and microservices are?

What is a monolithic architecture?

Consider a web application, when we deploy all the modules into a single unit of production code. It is called monolithic architecture. 
Each and every module contains a relationship with other modules in the production code. There exists a strong dependency between them. 

A better way to conclude this, it is the housing of all modules together with interdependencies among each other in the production code. This approach in software development design is called monolithic arachitecture

What are micro-services?

In micro-services architecture, the entire application code (production code) is broken down into several parts. Where it can be developed, deployed, and managed as seperate services

One of the drawbacks of monolithic architecture is that, due to internal dependencies between modules. Even if one module experiences an issue the entire application code is at risk of failure.
A single bug can compromise the entire application

What is virtualization?

It is the practice of creating a virtual eco-system that contains multiple virtual machines where each VM is running its own operating system. All of this is managed by the hypervisor. The main purpose of the hypervisor is used to allocate and distribute virtual hardware resources to numerours virtual machines based on their needs and requirements.

There are 2 types of virtualization:

a) Bare-metal hypervisors
b) Hosted Hypervisors

What is containerization?

Containerization is a technology that packages and deployes application code fragments into individual services on isolated containers. Each service handling a specific function and communicating with each other forming the entire application.

I use Ubuntu OS, to install the software package execute the code below

update the existing system packages using the sudo apt update -y command

Once done, go ahead and install the docker application using the following command

sudo apt install docker.io -y

To check whether the service is actively running or not

sudo systemctl status docker

To start running the service, use this command

sudo systemctl start docker

To check the version, run this command

docker --version
