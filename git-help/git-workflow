Git workflow instructions

Once the company project repository is cloned in your local machine

Step-1: remote master -> local master
	Switch to your local master using git checkout <local-master-name>
 	Use the command git pull origin master to get the latest commits

Step-2: local master -> local branch
	Switch to your local branch or feature branch by executing git checkout <local-branch-name>
	Sync the latest commits from the local master to the local branch
	Use git rebase master

Step-3: Make the necessary changes to the respective files. Stage them using git add . or git add <file-name>
	Once staged, proceed with the commit using git commit -m "Enter message here"

	Repeat step-1 & step-2, get the merge conflicts resolved manually. Do communicate with the developers back and forth on what code needs to be present or removed.

Step-4: Push the local branch to the remote branch
	Using the command, git push origin <local-branch-name>:<remote-branch-name> or git push origin <remote-branch-name>

Step-5: Now, switch to github to complete the entire workflow process
	switch to the remote branch and create a new Pull request (PR). Wait for the reviewer to analyze the end product. If there are no errors in the final production code it will be merged into the master/main branch
