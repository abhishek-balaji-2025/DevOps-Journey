# 🔧 CI/CD Build Tools by Language (Essentials)

In CI/CD, the build stage depends on the project’s language. Here are the key tools used in the industry:

---

## ☕ Java
- **Maven** / **Gradle**
- Builds `.jar` / `.war` files
- Manages dependencies and runs tests

---

## 🌐 Node.js
- **npm** / **yarn**
- Installs packages, runs scripts (build, test, lint)
- Often used with bundlers like Webpack

---

## 🐍 Python
- **pip** / **poetry**
- Installs from `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
- Works with testing tools like `pytest`

---

## 🦫 Go
- **go build**
- Compiles Go code into static binaries
- Uses `go mod` for dependency management

---

## 🧠 Summary
Choose the right build tool based on the language. This step prepares your code for testing and packaging in CI/CD pipelines.
