# DevOps-Journey
A personal journey into the world of DevOps. This repository will contain code, configurations, and tools I've explored and implemented while learning about Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), Infrastructure as Code (IaC), monitoring, automation, containerization, and cloud services like AWS, Azure, and others.
